          I'm Arman Saffari, a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Web
          Developer based in Toronto. With a strong enthusiasm for continuous
          learning and growth in web development, I thrive on building
          innovative and user-friendly web applications. With experience as a
          team member and coordinator, I have honed my skills in
          collaboration, problem-solving, and independent initiative. I
          embrace new technologies and frameworks, and my ability to learn
          fast and adapt quickly has allowed me to successfully apply
          cutting-edge tools such as React, Node.js, and Express. My attention
          to detail and my expertise in both front-end and back-end
          development enable me to create seamless and engaging user
          experiences. I am driven by my passion for creating impactful
          digital solutions and look forward to taking on new challenges in
          the ever-evolving world of web development.
